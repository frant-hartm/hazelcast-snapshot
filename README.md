# Docker containers for Hazelcast snapshots

The `Dockerfile` builds the Hazelcast snapshot version for a Hazelcast git branch. Snapshot images are intended for Hazelcast internal
usage and they may be changed or removed without prior notice.

Hazelcast Snapshot Images are currently based on the [Distroless Java base image](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/tree/master/java).
